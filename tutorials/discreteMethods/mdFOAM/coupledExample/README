This is a simple coupled example using MUI between two instances of mdFOAM, it has no real purpose other than to demonstrate how to use the functionality.

For details on how MUI has been fundamentally integrated into OpenFOAM see the document in the base of the repository called "README-MUI". For details on how MUI has been integrated into mdFOAM specifically see the associated document in the base of the mdFOAM application directory.

This case does the following:

1) Runs two instances of mdFOAM simultaneously (either in serial or parallel)
2) Each instance solves a simple equilibrated water cube problem to 0.1s, however one has a lower molecular mass than the other to differentiate them
3) Each instance creates a single 3D MUI coupling interface
4) Each instance sends the average molecular mass and density for each cell in its mesh, with the associated point at the centre of each cell, this happens at every time-step
5) The master process for each instance writes out the data receieved to a file in the polyCoupling controller folder within the uniform directory in each [time] output folder whenever output occurs (every 0.012 s)

There are a number of scripts in the base of the case to ease running, you should look at these to understand what they are doing, however their descriptions are:

1) coupledCaseCleanCreate: This completely cleans and re-creates the cases in the two case folders for a parallel run (default 2 CPUs per instance)
2) coupledCaseCleanCreateSerial: As above but running each instance in serial
3) coupledCaseRun: This runs the coupled case in parallel (default 2 CPUs per instance), by default console output is directed to the console, this can get confusing as both instances output simultaneously, therefore a commented version of the run command can also be found in this file that directs output to a file.
4) coupledCaseRunSerial: As above but each instance is run in serial

The two pertinent control dictionaries are located at system/couplingDict (this is described in greater detail in the README-MUI document) and system/controllersDict, where an entry for the new "polyCouplingControllers" control type can be found.
