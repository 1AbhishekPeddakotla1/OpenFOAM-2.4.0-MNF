This is a simple coupled example using MUI between three instances of mdFoamPlus, it has no real purpose other than to demonstrate how to use the functionality.

For details on how MUI has been fundamentally integrated into OpenFOAM see the document in the base of the repository called "README-MUI". For details on how MUI has been integrated into mdFoamPlus specifically see the associated document in the base of the mdFoamPlus application directory.

This example case does the following:

1) Runs three instances of mdFOAM simultaneously (either in serial or parallel)
2) Each instance solves a simple identical equilibrated water cube problem to 0.1s
3) Each instance is considered to be a seperate domain (named mdFoamPlus_1, mdFoamPlus_2 & mdFoamPlus_3)
4) The system creates 3 MUI interfaces (ifs_1and2, ifs_1and3, ifs_2and3)
5) Each instance sends the average molecular mass and density for each cell in its mesh, with the associated point at the centre of each cell to the appropriate 2 interfaces (i.e. for mdFoamPlus_1 this is to ifs_1and2 and ifs_1and3) and also receives the same values from the interfaces sent from the connected domain
6) The master process for each instance writes out the data receieved to 2 files in the polyCoupling controller folder within the uniform directory in each [time] output folder whenever output occurs (every 0.012 s)

There are a number of scripts in the base of the case to ease running, you should look at these to understand what they are doing, however their descriptions are:

1) coupledCaseCleanCreate: This completely cleans and re-creates the cases in the three case folders for a parallel run (default 2 CPUs per instance)
2) coupledCaseCleanCreateSerial: As above but running each instance in serial
3) coupledCaseRun: This runs the coupled case in parallel (default 2 CPUs per instance), by default console output is directed to the console, this can get confusing as all instances output simultaneously, therefore a commented version of the run command can also be found in this file that directs output to a file.
4) coupledCaseRunSerial: As above but each instance is run in serial

The two pertinent control dictionaries are located at system/couplingDict (this is described in greater detail in the README-MUI document) and system/controllersDict, where an entry for the new "polyCouplingControllers" control type can be found.

For a figurative description of the coupling toplogy created, please see the image "coupledCase_Topology.png", which is located in the same directory as this readme.
